\section{Introduction}

My name is Apostolos Chalkis. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Athens. My research focuses on geometric random walks for high dimensional sampling with applications in volume computation, optimization and financial modeling.

\section{Background}

My bachelor and master studies was focused on computational mathematics and statistics, and algorithms. The main field of my PhD is computational geometry, statistics
and mathematical software.
Thus, I have a very good understanding and solid theoretical background on the topic of
the current proposal as I have been doing research and contribute with some new results.

Moreover, I am an active open source programmer. 
I have participated in Google summer of Code (GSoC) 2018 and 2019 as a student / intern and I am one of the authors of package \volesti. 
During GSoC 2018 I extended \volesti\ with new efficient sampling and volume approximation algorithms which lead to the first {\tt CRAN} version. 
During GSoC 2019 I equipped \volesti\ with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers for uniform and spherical Gaussian sampling and new volume approximation algorithms. I am currently, one of the administrators and mentors of {\tt GeomScale} organization in GSoC. %Hence, I know very well the structure of \volesti\ and the steps I have to implement to complete successfully this project.

\section{Trajectory}
I am very excited with the opportunity of Tweag Fellowship because I will be able to combine my PhD studies with a fellowship of great quality;
without taking an unpaid leave. It is my belief that the practical study of mixing time, besides its practical importance will lead to a high quality paper submission in a statistical conference. Moreover, it is a natural extension to study metabolic networks of thousands of reactions and metabolites for the first time and hence provide options to biologists that were not possible in the past. {\tt Tweag} Fellowship will be a decisive contribution to my PhD studies to help me produce high quality research results.% and make the next step of my scientific journey.
%\todo[inline]{and you will also contribute to the company, to the open source community and to the world.}

\section{Working Conditions}
I would like to start the project on 1st September 2020 and end on 24 November 2020 (12 weeks), but of course I am open to other suggestions. I will work remotely from Athens, Greece. I will not have any other projects or source of income during that period. This project will be a full time job for me. I will not need any additional resource (hardware, office, relocation etc).
